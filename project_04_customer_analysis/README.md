## Business Question 
How does customer spending differ across age groups, and which age group generates the highest total spend?

## Dataset 
Customer-level dataset containing demographic and transactional information:
- age 
- country 
- total_spend
- orders_count 
- signup_date

Each row represents a single customer.

## Visualization 
The bar chart shows total customer spending per age group, allowing a clear comparison between different age segments.

## Key Insight 
Middle-aged customers (ages 30-49) generate the highest total spend compared to younger and senior customers.

## Business Implication 
The middle-age segment represents the most valuable customer group for the business.
Marketing and retention strategies should prioritize this segment, while additional growth opportunities may exist among younger customers.
